CurrentProblem:
    RCLi:
        -Implement basic synchronous logger

        -Implement conccurency (threads) and locking(mutex?).
            -Lock stdout when writting from Terminal 
                -Logger
            -Lock files during usage

        -Implement more generic grep

    lexer/parser:
        -Todo:Rewrite tests
    
        

STUDY:
    Rust general:
        -Generics, Traits, Lifetimes, Closures, SmartPointers, Iterators, Advanced Rust
    
    Unix terminal:
        GNU Manual: 
            https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/coreutils.html
        Terminal:

Project:
    -In unix when providing & the command runs asynchronously, this could be achieved by 
    creating a thread that runs the operation
    
    -Note:When trying to cd in D:(Daddy) it instnaly goes to RCli project folder


invoker:
    -Implement cp ./ -d ../ --clean
        -Flag --clean Removes original files
        -We have move tho..?
    -Implement ls -a
        -Flag to show types permissions and date 
    -Implement help
        -Shows available commands and invocation
    -Implement find
        -Searching dataset to match a string loosely
    -Implement shortcut 
        -Adds an alias for a executable (probably) and saves it in a retrievable document
    -Implement enable
        -Enables debug logging from logger (reader, lexer, parser, invoker)
            -Terminal will use stdout


terminal:
    https://docs.rs/crossterm/latest/crossterm/index.html#
    -Note:Accept raw input with Crossterm which is included in ratatui?
        -I.E. newline, CTRL^C etc
        -Handle with lexer or parser?
