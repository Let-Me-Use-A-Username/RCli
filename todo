CurrentProblem:
    RCLi:
        -input_reader/lexer:
            -Accept objects that have a space inbetween by parsing strings "Funny Noita.txt"
        -invoker:
            -Consider not printing the objects from [list, read] in order to use them in other functions (like grep)
                -Print the return values when we exit the functions
        -invoker:
            -Consider changing input for functions to be a Data type in order to be able to pipe things easier later on
            -Implement grep(global regular expression search and print)
                -Grep accepts a data type (piping reasons) and depending on the type we handle differently
                    -I.e. FileData/BufferedStringData returns string stream where we match pattern matches line
                    -I.e. DirVecData returns string stream where pattern matches name



        -Implement sub command > or | to pipeline
            -Idea:Pipe either resets the arguments in order to interpret core command again
            or it could invoke it self again with the input received after the pipe token


    
    lexer/parser/bsftree:
        -Todo:New objects implementation broke the tests, rewrite them
        -Todo:Parser tree_match also broke..

    -Note:Read how Unix shell and commands work in order to mimick the functionality


Project:
    https://dhghomon.github.io/easy_rust/Chapter_61.html 
    -Todo:Logger to log output
        -parser operations
        -terminal operations


invoker:
    -Implement cp ./ -d ../ --clean
        -Flag --clean Removes original files

    -Implement find
        -Searching dataset to match a string loosely
    -Implement shortcut 
        -Adds an alias for a executable (probably) and saves it in a retrievable document

    -Todo:Reformated invoker
        -Note:Consider whether an object invoker with methods would be better
        -Todo:Find a more concrete way to move files/dirs instead of copying
        -Note:When trying to cd in D:(Daddy) it instnaly goes to RCli project folder


terminal:
    -Note:Every terminal instance should be a singlenton.
        -Therefore when a new terminal is started it is assigned a new singlenton.

    -Note:Accept raw input with Crossterm which is included in ratatui?
        -I.E. newline, CTRL^C etc
        -Handle with lexer or parser?
