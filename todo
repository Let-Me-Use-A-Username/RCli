CurrentProblem:
    RCLi:
        -Reformat everything
            -Lexer verifies only the order. Nothing else.
            -Parser verifies that token syntax is correct <-Here
                -When flag has an object 
                    -Verify that an object is next
                    -Create a new Token that is a pair
                        -Pass this in invoker instead of TokenFlag
            -Invoker invokes command

        -Implement sub command > or | to pipeline
            -Idea:Pipe either resets the arguments in order to interpret core command again
            or it could invoke it self again with the input received after the pipe token

    invoker:
        -Implement grep(global regular expression search and print)
            -First parameter is path, second is -r "regex"
                -if path is dir search to find file with regex match
                    -should have --resursive flag to search recursive files/dirs
                -else if path is file read it and match regex
    
    
    lexer/parser/bsftree:
        -Todo:New objects implementation broke the tests, rewrite them
        -Todo:Parser tree_match also broke..

Project:
    https://dhghomon.github.io/easy_rust/Chapter_61.html 
    -Todo:Logger to log output
        -parser operations
        -terminal operations


invoker:
    -Implement cp ./ -d ../ --clean
        -Flag --clean Removes original files

    -Implement find
        -Searching dataset to match a string loosely
    -Implement shortcut 
        -Adds an alias for a executable (probably) and saves it in a retrievable document

    -Todo:Reformated invoker
        -Note:Consider whether an object invoker with methods would be better
        -Todo:Find a more concrete way to move files/dirs instead of copying
        -Note:When trying to cd in D:(Daddy) it instnaly goes to RCli project folder


terminal:
    -Note:Every terminal instance should be a singlenton.
        -Therefore when a new terminal is started it is assigned a new singlenton.

    -Note:Accept raw input with Crossterm which is included in ratatui?
        -I.E. newline, CTRL^C etc
        -Handle with lexer or parser?
