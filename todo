CurrentProblem:
    RCLi:
        -parser/invoker:
            -Try to make simpler
            -piping to touch works
            -piping to grep doesnt


    lexer/parser/bsftree:
        -Todo:Rewrite tests
        -Todo:Rewrite bsftree

    https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/reference.html
    -Note:Read how Unix shell and commands work in order to mimick the functionality


Project:
    https://dhghomon.github.io/easy_rust/Chapter_61.html 
    -Todo:Logger to log output
        -parser operations
        -terminal operations
    -Note:When trying to cd in D:(Daddy) it instnaly goes to RCli project folder


invoker:
    -Implement cp ./ -d ../ --clean
        -Flag --clean Removes original files
    -Implement grep -p smt -any also implement recursive
        -Flag that will match anything (meaning convert names to lowercase, with space or not etc)
    -Implement ls -r 
        -Flag for recursive search
    -Implement ls -a
        -Flag to show types permissions and date 
            -Mainly to show types
    -Implement help
        -Shows available commands and invocation
    -Implement find
        -Searching dataset to match a string loosely
    -Implement shortcut 
        -Adds an alias for a executable (probably) and saves it in a retrievable document


terminal:
    -Note:Every terminal instance should be a singlenton.
        -Therefore when a new terminal is started it is assigned a new singlenton.

    -Note:Accept raw input with Crossterm which is included in ratatui?
        -I.E. newline, CTRL^C etc
        -Handle with lexer or parser?
