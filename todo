CurrentProblem:
    -invoker traverse_directory
        -for some reason canonicalize doesn't work when directory is below root for example
        when trying to do cd .. in dir C:/Projects it will not go further up. This has to be resolved

Project:
    -Todo:Logger to log output
        -parser operations
        -terminal operations

RCLi:
    -Todo:Change big if statemets to patterns
    -Todo:Handle errors better in general
        -Example:change the unwraping of UserInput
    -Todo:Reformat when the parser works to a certain acceptable degree
        -Todo:Add shorthand invocation. list -> ls
    -Todo:When rcli works fully in windows, make Unix variation. MacOS?


lexical:
    -Todo:rewrite tests since the singlenton broke them


parser:
    -Note:consider whether matching commands is better than tree implementation


invoker:
    -Note:Right now the second parameter is always a  path, what happens if it is a flag?


terminal:
    -Note:Every terminal instance should be a singlenton.
        -Therefore when a new terminal is started it is assigned a new singlenton.
    -Todo:change user interface to ratatui
