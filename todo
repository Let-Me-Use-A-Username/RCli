CurrentProblem:
    RCLi:
        -parser:
            -Make sure the first command is a core command
            -create_chain now parses additional core commands
                -fix parse(), so that there is a core command, core object and then the rest of the command
                    -which can include core commands, solo flags, flag pairs

        -invoker:
            -Consider changing input for functions to be a Data type in order to be able to pipe things easier later on
            -Implement sub command | to pipeline
                -Idea:Pipe either resets the arguments in order to interpret core command again
                or it could invoke it self again with the input received after the pipe token
                    -ls -h | grep *.txt
                    -lexer = [COMMAND(ls), OBJECT(current_dir), FLAG(HIDDEN), SUB(PIPE), COMMAND(GREP), OBJECT(current_dir), FLAG(PATTERN, *.txt)]
                    

    
    lexer/parser/bsftree:
        -Todo:New objects implementation broke the tests, rewrite them
        -Todo:Parser tree_match also broke..

    -Note:Read how Unix shell and commands work in order to mimick the functionality


Project:
    https://dhghomon.github.io/easy_rust/Chapter_61.html 
    -Todo:Logger to log output
        -parser operations
        -terminal operations


invoker:
    -Implement cp ./ -d ../ --clean
        -Flag --clean Removes original files
    -Implement help
        -Shows available commands and invocation
    -Implement find
        -Searching dataset to match a string loosely
    -Implement shortcut 
        -Adds an alias for a executable (probably) and saves it in a retrievable document

    -Todo:Reformated invoker
        -Todo:Find a more concrete way to move files/dirs instead of copying
        -Note:When trying to cd in D:(Daddy) it instnaly goes to RCli project folder


terminal:
    -Note:Every terminal instance should be a singlenton.
        -Therefore when a new terminal is started it is assigned a new singlenton.

    -Note:Accept raw input with Crossterm which is included in ratatui?
        -I.E. newline, CTRL^C etc
        -Handle with lexer or parser?
