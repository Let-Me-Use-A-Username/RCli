Current:
    RCLi:
        -Implement locking(mutex?).
            -Lock files during usage
        
        -implement conccurency (threads)
            -Teminal will hold the TUI (most likely)
            -Parsing operations will be threaded(???)

    lexer/parser:
        -Implement more generic grep
        -Todo:Rewrite tests
    
        

Project:
    -Asynchronous:
        -In unix when providing & the command runs asynchronously, this could be achieved by 
        creating a thread that runs the operation


invoker:
    -Implement cp --force
        -Flag --force overwrites data if file exists at location
    -Implement ls -a
        -Flag to show types additional information
            -User permissions, data created, data modified
    -Implement help
        -Shows available commands and invocation
    -Implement shortcut 
        -Adds an alias for a executable (probably) and saves it in a retrievable document


terminal:
    https://docs.rs/crossterm/latest/crossterm/index.html#
    -Basic TUI
    -Note:Accept raw input with Crossterm which is included in ratatui?
        -I.E. newline, CTRL^C etc
        -Handle with lexer or parser?
