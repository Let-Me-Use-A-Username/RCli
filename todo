General:
    -Change big if statemets to patterns

Tree:
    -IDEA, load grammar from grammar reader and create a tree based on what variable can be next
        -Hashmap that has Token:CoreCommands as keys and Token:Objects, Token:Flags as a vector
            -if the input tokens match the syntax
            -parse the tokens that were the original input

    -Check command structure with tree
    -Validate command tree
    -If file not found and dir not found then dir is current working directory(?)
