Current:
    RCLi:
        -Implement locking(mutex?).
            -Lock files during usage
        
        -implement conccurency (threads)
            -Changed implementation so now Shell instance has a terminal and a logger.
            -Teminal will hold the TUI (most likely)
            -Parsing operations will be threaded(???)


    lexer/parser:
        -Implement more generic grep
        -Todo:Rewrite tests

Project:
    -Asynchronous:
        -In unix when providing & the command runs asynchronously, this could be achieved by 
        creating a thread that runs the operation
    
    -Note: When trying to cd in D:(Daddy) it instnaly goes to RCli project folder


invoker:
    -Implement cp ./ -d ../ --clean
        -Flag --clean Removes original files
        -We have move tho..?
    -Implement ls -a
        -Flag to show types permissions and date 
    -Implement help
        -Shows available commands and invocation
    -Implement find
        -Searching dataset to match a string loosely
    -Implement shortcut 
        -Adds an alias for a executable (probably) and saves it in a retrievable document
    -Implement enable
        -Enables debug logging from logger (reader, lexer, parser, invoker)
            -Terminal will use stdout


terminal:
    https://docs.rs/crossterm/latest/crossterm/index.html#
    -Basic TUI
    -Note:Accept raw input with Crossterm which is included in ratatui?
        -I.E. newline, CTRL^C etc
        -Handle with lexer or parser?
