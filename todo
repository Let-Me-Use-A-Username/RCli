CurrentProblem:
    -invoker
        -Todo:When trying to cd in a local directory "Desktop" it is not found due to regex
        however if prompted ./Desktop it does find it
    -singlenton
        -Note:consider whether the path has to be saved as canonical or not
            -also whether is should be displayed as one

Project:
    -Todo:Logger to log output
        -parser operations
        -terminal operations

RCLi:
    -Todo:Change big if statemets to patterns
    -Todo:Handle errors better in general
        -Example:change the unwraping of UserInput
    -Todo:Reformat when the parser works to a certain acceptable degree


lexical:
    -Todo:rewrite tests since the singlenton broke them


parser:
    -Note:consider whether matching commands is better than tree implementation


invoker:
    -Note:Right now the second parameter is always a  path, what happens if it is a flag?


terminal:
    -Note:Every terminal instance should be a singlenton.
        -Therefore when a new terminal is started it is assigned a new singlenton.
    -Todo:change user interface to ratatui
