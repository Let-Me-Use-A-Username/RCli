CurrentProblem:
    RCLi:
        -Should grep implement recursion?
            -It makes it more complicated
        -Moving to different level of directories (with move) fails the process 
        -Implement more generic grep

Project:
    https://dhghomon.github.io/easy_rust/Chapter_61.html 
    -Todo:Logger to log output
        -parser operations
        -terminal operations
    -Note:When trying to cd in D:(Daddy) it instnaly goes to RCli project folder


invoker:
    -Implement cp ./ -d ../ --clean
        -Flag --clean Removes original files
    -Implement ls -a
        -Flag to show types permissions and date 
            -Mainly to show types
    -Implement help
        -Shows available commands and invocation
    -Implement find
        -Searching dataset to match a string loosely
    -Implement shortcut 
        -Adds an alias for a executable (probably) and saves it in a retrievable document


terminal:
    https://docs.rs/crossterm/latest/crossterm/index.html#
    -Note:Accept raw input with Crossterm which is included in ratatui?
        -I.E. newline, CTRL^C etc
        -Handle with lexer or parser?
