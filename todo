CurrentProblem:
    invoker:
        -Todo:More concrete way to extract flags. Implement cp ./ -d ../ --force
            -Flag --force Removes original files
            -Additionally check when cp from one file to another copies content

        https://crates.io/crates/windows-permissions
        -Todo:Use one of the above to resolve the permision problem in rename()
            -Todo:consider the following. If we simply rename in the same file/folder then invoke rename.
            in other case call copy , and then rename(?)

        -Todo:When trying to cd in D: (Daddy) it instnaly goes to RCli project folder
        


    lexer/parser/bsftree:
        -Todo:New objects implementation broke the tests, rewrite them
        -Todo:Parser tree_match also broke..
    
    Project:
        https://crates.io/crates/dirs
        -Todo:Add documentation for everything with /// and #[doc(inline)] to display info when overhead

    -Note:Read how Unix shell and commands work in order to mimick the functionality


Project:
    https://dhghomon.github.io/easy_rust/Chapter_61.html
    -Todo:Logger to log output
        -parser operations
        -terminal operations


RCLi:
    -Todo:Change big if statemets to patterns or do something better
    -Todo:Handle errors better in general
    -Todo:Add pipelining with > or |



parser:
    -Note:consider whether matching commands is better than tree implementation
        -This will most likely need 
            1)a new command_grammar than contains core invocations
            2)a tree that contains a form of struct with a function as a parameter
            3)invocation will change from match to tree parsing


terminal:
    -Note:Every terminal instance should be a singlenton.
        -Therefore when a new terminal is started it is assigned a new singlenton.

    -Note:Accept raw input with Crossterm which is included in ratatui?
        -I.E. newline, CTRL^C etc
        -Handle with lexer or parser?
