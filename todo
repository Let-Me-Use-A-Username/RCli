    https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/reference.html
    -Note:Read how Unix shell and commands work in order to mimick the functionality

CurrentProblem:
    -Lexer:Consider changing the way core commands match.
        -create another grammar that contains the 
            type(core sub etc)
            shorthand invocations
            valid flags
            next_valid_token (?)
    -Lexer:Consider adding soft commands
        -Soft commands are strings that are not commands
        I.E. new_line

    https://docs.rs/dirs/5.0.1/dirs/
    -Todo:Singlenton:Add user home and root dir (C:/) (?)

    -Consider add crate to parse paths instaed of messy code.

Project:
    https://dhghomon.github.io/easy_rust/Chapter_61.html
    -Todo:Logger to log output
        -parser operations
        -terminal operations

RCLi:
    -Todo:Change big if statemets to patterns or do something better
    -Todo:Handle errors better in general
        -Example:change the unwraping of UserInput
    -Todo:Reformat when the parser works to a certain acceptable degree
    -Todo:Add shorthand invocation. list -> ls

parser:
    -Note:consider whether matching commands is better than tree implementation
        -This will most likely need 
            1)a new command_grammar than contains core invocations
            2)a tree that contains a form of struct with a function as a parameter
            3)invocation will change from match to tree parsing


invoker/dotparser:
    -Todo:Change the way traversal to root dir is handled, this is stupid.
    -Todo:Consider perhaps using only components and figure it out on the way.. ?


terminal:
    -Note:Every terminal instance should be a singlenton.
        -Therefore when a new terminal is started it is assigned a new singlenton.

    -Note:Accept raw input with Crossterm which is included in ratatui?
        -I.E. newline, CTRL^C etc
