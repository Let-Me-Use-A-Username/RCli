Current:
    RCLi:
        -function touch
            -doesnt write new lines

        -Implement redirect
            -Probably by using touch

        -Implement locking(mutex?).
            -Lock files during usage
        
        -implement conccurency (threads)
            -Teminal will hold the TUI (most likely)
            -Parsing operations will be threaded(???)
        
        -Write extensive tests for all modules
    
        

Project Consideration and Ideas:
    -Implement then
        -Provide additional commands, for example
            home | cd then cd Desktop

    -I/O in C:
        -Due to Rust not having implemented Window calls to a low (enough) degree, consider 
        changing function calls that perform I/O operation to C code and import it in Rust.
            -This I believe will provide greater handling that using Rust (for the moment at least)

    -OS and other Signals:
        -Read on signals https://blog.logrocket.com/guide-signal-handling-rust/
        -Handle signals from OS (CTRL^C for example)

    -Asynchronous command calls:
        -In unix when providing & the command runs asynchronously, this could be achieved by 
        creating a thread that runs the operation
    
    -Flag usages
            -Implement ls -l to dereference symlink, hardlink and junctions(windows) would also like shortcuts
                -Dropped the idea for now


invoker:
    -ls command
        -Implement ls -v -verbose
            -Flag to show types additional information
                -User permissions, data created, data modified
        -Implement -p (pattern) ??? dont know
    -Implement dir
        -List dirs in a directory
    -Implement link
        -Create hard / soft link
        -link creates hard links with no error checlk
        -ln creates soft links with error checking
            -Concatenate these two functions??
    -Implement readlink
        -Displays soft/hard link target
    -Implement realpath
        -Canonicalized a path
            -I.E. removes . , .. and /
    -Implement kill
        -Stops a process
    -Implement tee
        -Pipes stdin to space separated files 
    -Implement help
        -Shows available commands and invocation
            -Probably from hardcoded messages that match against the command name
    -Implement shortcut 
        -Adds an alias for a executable (probably) and saves it in a retrievable document


terminal:
    https://docs.rs/crossterm/latest/crossterm/index.html#
    -Basic TUI
    -Note:Accept raw input with Crossterm which is included in ratatui?
        -I.E. newline, CTRL^C etc
        -Handle with lexer or parser?
